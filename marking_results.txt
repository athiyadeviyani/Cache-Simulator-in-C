This assignment counts for 20% of the overall mark for the Inf2C-CS course.

Marking Scheme
==============

Submissions were marked out of 100 based on the following criteria. 
All marks displayed are absolute (out of 100).

Test Method:
    We run a number of tests which test various aspects of the simulator. The tests are posted on Learn (Syllabus page).
    We first run correctness tests, which check all valid configurations
    of the simulator. 

    This is followed by specific tests that stress test various aspects
    of the implementation, e.g. correctness of the LRU implementation.

    Marks within each type of test are as follows:

    - Correctness tests check all possible configurations.
        - Marks are given for:
            - Cache Tag Bits
            - Cache Offset Bits
    - All other tests each check one particular configuration.
        - Marks are given for: 
            - Cache:hits
            - Cache:misses
    

The overall marking scheme is as follows:
Testing (70%)
    - Correct cache configuration (20%) - Check tag, offset
        - Sweep replacement policy, cache size, associativity and block size.
    - Depth testing (50%) - Check hits, misses
        - Valid bit test (Tag=0, Tag=-1): 10%
            - Check that tags matching initial cache state aren't counted as hits.
        - Block offset test (DM): 10%
            - Check that only the right set of bits for the tag is stored, not the full access address
        - DM block thrash vs 2-way SA: 10%
            - Trace that evicts blocks soon after they are pulled into the cache in a DM configuration.
        - Replacement policy (in SA and FA configurations with the provided trace): 10%  
            - Test with trace exploiting temporal locality --> LRU should beat FIFO.
        - Memory allocation : 10% 
            - Test with a very long trace to make sure memory doesn't run out. 

Compilation and Execution (10%)

    - Compiles error-free (5%)  (allowed flags: -std=gnu99 -lm)
    - Runs without errors, segfaults, etc (5%)

Code Quality (20%)

    - Readability - 8%
        - Modularity - 3%
        - Naming convention - 3%
        - Indents - 2%
    - Comments - 4%
    - Libs & memory usage - 8%
        - Allowed libs only (whatever was in the skeleton file) - 3%
        - malloc - 5%
